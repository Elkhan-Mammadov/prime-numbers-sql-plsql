Prime Numbers in SQL and PL/SQL
This repository contains two implementations to find prime numbers up to a specified limit using Oracle database:

SQL Version: Uses a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to generate numbers and filter prime numbers.

PL/SQL Version: Uses nested loops to check divisibility and identify prime numbers procedurally.


How to Use

Replace the input number (&number in PL/SQL or bind variable in SQL) with your desired upper limit.

Run the scripts in your Oracle environment.

The output will list all prime numbers from 2 up to the specified number.
